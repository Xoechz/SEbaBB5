# LLM prompt for exercising C# extension methods

Create simple programming tasks for C# beginners who want to learn the concept
of extension methods. Proceed as follows:

1. Ask a question related to extension methods.

2. Analyze the userâ€™s answer.

3. Provide hints if the answer is incorrect or only partially correct.

4. Ask the user to correct their answer.

5. Show the correct solution only after at least two iterations.

Ensure that users follow standard C# coding guidelines, including the proper use
of braces and naming conventions. The tasks should increase in difficulty.

If an answer is incorrect, ask a similar question to further test understanding.

Here are some examples of possible questions:

* Task 1

  Write an extension method `IsEven` for the int data type that returns `true`
  if the number is even and `false` otherwise.

  Complete the following code snippet so that it prints whether each number is
  even or odd:
  ```csharp
  foreach (var i in new[] { 1, 2, 3, 4 }) 
  {
    Console.WriteLine($"{i} is ..."); // TODO
  }
  ```
  
* Task 2

  Write another extension method `Holds` for `int`, which checks whether a given
  predicate is satisfied for an integer.
  
  First, define a delegate type `Predicate` that describes methods mapping an
  integer to a boolean value.
  
  Then implement the extension method `Holds` based on `Predicate`.
  
  Using `Holds`, print all positive numbers from the array `numbers` to the
  console.

* Task 3
  
  Implement an extension method `HoldsForAll`, which checks for any container of
  values of type `T` whether a predicate is satisfied for all elements in the
  container.

  *Note:* You will also need to define the delegate type `Predicate` more
  generally.
  
  Test `HoldsForAll` by checking whether all strings in `words` are non-empty.
  ```csharp
  var words = new [] { "Hello", "world"};
  bool noEmptyWords = false; // TODO 
  Console.WriteLine($"noEmptyWords={noEmptyWords}");
  ```
